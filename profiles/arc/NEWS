   - Fix advertising by sending the correct byte-sequences to the
     HCI-device. The advertising data consists of the ARC-uuid, and there rest
     of the 31-byte advertising data is use for a (possibly truncated) version
     of the name (you can get the full name using the GATT-characterics)
   - Fix build on systems with pre-2.17 glibcs, by adding the -lrt in the
     right places.
   - Added documentation -- README.org
